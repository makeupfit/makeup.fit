    h3 Arbitration
    p
      | At Makeup.Fit, Inc.&rsquo;s or your election, all disputes, claims, or
      | controversies arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or the
      | Service that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by
      | binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor.
      | Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in
      | City and County of San Francisco, California before a single arbitrator
      | mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually
      | agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in
      | accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless
      | specifically modified in the Terms of Service. The arbitration must
      | commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written
      | demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator&rsquo;s
      | decision and award will be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of
      | the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the
      | selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the power to
      | award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory,
      | direct damages set forth in the Terms of Service and may not multiply
      | actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are
      | specifically excluded under the Terms of Service, and each party hereby
      | irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator may, in
      | his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the
      | reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any
      | party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of
      | the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including
      | attorneys&rsquo; fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the
      | award.
    p
      | Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary
      | injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior
      | arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm.
      | The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any
      | court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the provisions of the
      | introductory section above, if Makeup.Fit, Inc. changes this
      | &lsquo;Arbitration&rsquo; section after the date you first accepted
      | these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these
      | Terms of Service ), you may reject any such change by sending us
      | written notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective,
      | as indicated in the &ldquo;Date of Last Revision&rdquo; date above or
      | in the date of Makeup.Fit, Inc.&rsquo;s email to you notifying you of
      | such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will
      | arbitrate any dispute between you and Makeup.Fit, Inc. in accordance
      | with the provisions of this section as of the date you first accepted

      | the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give
      | effect to the parties&rsquo; intentions as reflected in the provision,
